Reddit Style Pipeline - Progress Tracker
Completed Steps
This document tracks the progress of completed steps in building the Reddit-style pipeline project, detailing what has been added to the Git repository and describing each file's purpose.
✅ 1. Project Repository & Environment Setup
* Created a GitHub repository named reddit-style-pipeline.
* Initialized a local Git repository and linked it to GitHub.
* Cloned the repository locally.
* Verified repository accessibility with git remote -v.
✅ 2. Virtual Environment Setup
* Verified Python version (>=3.9).
* Created a virtual environment (venv/).
* Excluded venv/ from Git commits using .gitignore.
✅ 3. Installing Dependencies
* Created requirements.txt to manage dependencies.
Added initial dependencies:
requests             # HTTP requests library for web scraping.
beautifulsoup4       # Parsing HTML for Reddit scraping.
* moviepy              # For basic video editing and slideshow generation.
* Installed dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
✅ 4. Establishing Project Structure
Created and verified the following directory structure:
reddit-style-pipeline/
├── venv/                # Virtual environment (excluded from Git)
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── README.md            # Project documentation
├── src/                 # Main source code directory
│   ├── main.py          # Entry point of the project
* ├── data/                # Directory for scraped data and logs
✅ 5. File Descriptions
Main Files Added to Git
* .gitignore: Ensures virtual environment (venv/) and unnecessary files are not committed.
* requirements.txt: Lists required dependencies for the project.
* README.md: Contains a project overview and setup instructions.
* src/ Directory: Contains the main project code.
   * main.py: Initial entry point for the project, used to test the environment setup.
* data/ Directory: Placeholder for storing scraped data, logs, or processed files.
✅ 6. Testing Basic Functionality
Implemented src/main.py to confirm the environment is working:
def main():
    print("Hello, Ouroboros Pipeline!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
*     main()
* Successfully ran python src/main.py to verify execution.
✅ 7. Initial Commit & GitHub Push
* Staged all files (git add .).
* Committed changes (git commit -m "Initial setup with fixed structure").
* Pushed updates to GitHub (git push origin main).

Next Steps (In Progress / To Be Completed)
🔲 8. Develop Cost Controller
* Implement a system to track API and resource costs.
* Define estimated costs for each operation (e.g., API calls, TTS usage, scraping).
* Develop logging for actual usage and comparison against estimates.
🔲 9. Implement Scraper Engine
* Set up lightweight data collection using Reddit API.
* Fetch and store competitor content (top posts, engagement data, etc.).
* Store scraped data in data/ directory.
🔲 10. Build Content Generator
* Implement AI-driven script generation using LLM (GPT-3.5 or local models if budget is tight).
* Integrate basic text-to-speech (TTS) functionality (Amazon Polly or local TTS tools).
* Store generated content in data/ for processing.
🔲 11. Automate Publishing & Feedback Collection
* Develop an API integration for YouTube posting.
* Store engagement metrics for performance tracking.
* Log publishing history and performance feedback in a database.
🔲 12. Optimize Budget & Scaling Logic
* Introduce auto-scaling mechanisms for expansion.
* Automate new account creation based on revenue and engagement metrics.
* Track budget constraints to dynamically adjust processing intensity.
